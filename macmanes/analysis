1) Blast+ "match assembled transcripts to their reference"
2) TransDecoder "to identify full-length transcripts"
3a) Find all "contigs whose identity was ≥99% similar to, and covering at least 90% of the reference sequence"
3b) Use Blat to identify and count nucleotide mismatches between reconstructed transcripts in the high-confidence datasets and their corresponding referenc
